        <a href = "https://repl.it/@PhuLam/Adventure-Program">Challenged</a>
        <p>In this python program, it introduces a short story between two friends who will be clashing.<br>
        It aims to show readers that although it is a match, friends are meant to stick around for you instead <br> of hurting them.
        </p>

		<h1>Python Story Reflection</h1>
		<p>
		In order, to create a perfectly running program which depicts the script, we used strings and functions. Although it may seem easy, there were some 
		difficulties <br>when starting this program. One of which was deciding which scenes to add in and have the readers input their choices. <br>
		To resolve it, we took it a step at a time and used our current knowledge to give readers choices to alter the story. <br> Another issue we faced was <br>
		the story itself. We wanted something simple and out of the ordinary because we deemed it entertaining to. <br> In order to accomplish that we brain stormed 
		some ideas, and we came up with <br>diverse ideas. These ideas were something out of our experience and one of which was games that we have played.
		<br> We were going to try to put the reader into an intense situation in a game that we have played and let them decide for themselves. <br>
		We though about it, but we also knew that no one was going to have much interest in the game<br> we played so we came up with airsoft match.
		At first, the script came out very long and inflexible so we decided to shorten it and <br>make it where the reader basically play god. In the end, 
		we concluded the plot to be a scrirmish<br> between two friends because it was short and interesting.

        <h1>Reflection</h1>
        <p>I made this game solely for entertainment and my inspiration came from a generic game of <br>
        duck hunt with a little spice of counterstrike theme.</p>
        <p>Additionally, If I had more resources I would improve the aspect of the game by adding mechanics to make the game<br> 
        more enjoyable. For an example, one mechanic I would add is to the aiming mechanic used in FPS.</p>

        <h1>Success</h1>
        <ol>
        	<li>Audio played when events occur</li>
         	<li>Game ends and restarts</li>
        </ol> <hr>
        <h1>Obstacles</h1>
        <ol>
        	<li>Getting audio to synchronize with events</li>
        	<li>Coming up with the sprites and their tasks</li>
        </ol><hr>
        <h1>Algorithm</h1>
        <p>An algorithm that was included with the game was the mouse detection. This algorithm is important <br>
        because it helps gives the player a chance to play the game and
        keep track of their score.
